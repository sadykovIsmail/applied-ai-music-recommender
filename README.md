# Music Recommender Simulation

## Project Summary

This project simulates a content-based music recommendation engine in Python. Given a user's taste profile — preferred genre, mood, and energy level — the system scores every song in a CSV catalog and returns the top-ranked matches along with a plain-language explanation for each result.

The goal is to understand how real platforms like Spotify translate raw data (song attributes + listener preferences) into ranked suggestions, and to identify where simple algorithms succeed and where they introduce bias.

## Current Capabilities

- Multi-source RAG explanations with source citations.
- AI DJ planner-executor-evaluator workflow with saved trace output.
- Specialized `vinyl_historian` persona mode with measurable comparison artifacts.
- Reliability scoring, warning surfacing, graceful fallback behavior, and per-run diagnostics.
- Automated harness coverage for happy-path, contradictory, invalid-input, retrieval-failure, and empty-catalog scenarios.

## How The System Works

### Real-World Recommendation Systems

Real platforms like Spotify use two main approaches. **Collaborative filtering** ignores the song itself and looks at what *other users* with similar listening histories enjoyed — if thousands of people who liked Song A also loved Song B, Spotify recommends B to you. **Content-based filtering** does the opposite: it ignores other users entirely and compares the *attributes of songs* (genre, tempo, mood, energy) directly to your stated or inferred preferences. Most production systems combine both into a hybrid. This simulation focuses purely on content-based filtering — it scores each song's attributes against a user taste profile and returns the best matches. The tradeoff is that it can explain every recommendation clearly but cannot discover unexpected connections the way collaborative filtering can.

### Song Features

Each `Song` object stores ten attributes read from `data/songs.csv`:

| Feature | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `genre` | string | Musical genre (pop, rock, lofi, jazz, …) |
| `mood` | string | Emotional feel (happy, chill, intense, …) |
| `energy` | float 0–1 | How driving or restful the track feels |
| `tempo_bpm` | float | Beats per minute |
| `valence` | float 0–1 | Musical positivity |
| `danceability` | float 0–1 | How suitable for dancing |
| `acousticness` | float 0–1 | How acoustic (vs. electronic) the track is |

### User Profile

A `UserProfile` stores four preferences:

- `favorite_genre` — the genre to reward most heavily
- `favorite_mood` — the mood that earns bonus points
- `target_energy` — the ideal energy level (0–1); proximity is scored continuously
- `likes_acoustic` — if `True`, high-acousticness songs earn a small bonus

### Scoring Algorithm

For each song, the recommender computes:

```
score = genre_bonus + mood_bonus + energy_proximity + acoustic_bonus
```

| Rule | Points |
|---|---|
| Genre matches user's favorite | +2.0 |
| Mood matches user's favorite | +1.0 |
| Energy proximity: `1.0 − |target − song.energy|` | 0.0 – 1.0 |
| High acousticness when user likes acoustic (≥ 0.6) | +0.5 |
| Low acousticness when user dislikes acoustic (< 0.4) | +0.3 |

Songs are ranked by total score (highest first) and the top-k are returned with a reason string.

## Getting Started

### Setup

1. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate      # Mac or Linux
   .venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the app:

   ```bash
   python -m src.main
   ```

4. Run the automated reliability harness:

   ```bash
   python -m scripts.test_harness
   ```

### Running Tests

```bash
python -m pytest -q
```

### Generated Artifacts

Running the app and harness writes the following reviewer-facing outputs to `outputs/`:

- `agent_trace_demo.json`
- `reliability_demo.json`
- `specialization_demo.json`
- `test_harness_results.json`
- `test_harness_summary.md`

## Experiments You Tried

### Experiment 1 — High-Energy Pop Fan (genre="pop", mood="happy", energy=0.85)

Top results were "Sunrise City" and "Gym Hero" — both pop tracks. This makes sense because genre carries the most weight (+2.0). Even though "Gym Hero" has an intense mood, it still outscores non-pop tracks that have a mood match.

**Observation:** Genre weight dominates. Songs with the right genre always appear near the top even if their mood is wrong.

### Experiment 2 — Chill Lofi Listener (genre="lofi", mood="chill", energy=0.38)

"Library Rain" and "Midnight Coding" both scored 3.97 and 3.96 — nearly tied because both match genre, mood, and have similar energy. "Focus Flow" came third by genre alone.

**Observation:** When two songs match all criteria, energy proximity breaks the tie.

### Experiment 3 — Deep Intense Rock (genre="rock", mood="intense", energy=0.92)

"Storm Runner" scored 3.99, nearly a perfect score. The second recommendation was "Roaring Sunrise" — also rock but with a happy mood — ranked higher than intense non-rock songs purely because of the genre bonus.

**Observation:** A rock-happy song beats an intense-metal song because genre matters more than mood in the current weights.

### Edge Case — High-Energy Ambient + Sad (conflicting preferences)

Profile: genre="ambient", mood="sad", energy=0.90

This is an adversarial profile designed to "trick" the system. Ambient music in the catalog is typically quiet (energy 0.22–0.28), so asking for ambient + high-energy is internally contradictory. The system surfaced the two ambient songs at the top (scores 2.38 and 2.32) because genre weight (+2.0) dominated everything. Both recommended songs had energy below 0.30 — the complete opposite of what the user wanted. Songs 3–5 were high-energy but had no genre or mood match, scoring only ~0.97–0.99.

**Finding:** When a user's genre preference conflicts with their energy preference, genre always wins under the current weights. The system cannot resolve conflicting signals — it just picks the highest scorer, even if the result is nonsensical.

### Weight-Shift Experiment

After temporarily doubling the energy weight and halving the genre weight, the rankings shifted: "Electronic Euphoria" (edm, energy=0.93) crept into the top 3 for the rock profile. This confirmed that the default weights anchor the recommender around genre identity.

## Limitations and Risks

- **Small catalog:** With only 20 songs, the top results repeat across different profiles.
- **Genre filter bubble:** Songs from an under-represented genre (e.g., metal, bossa nova) almost never surface even when they would be a good vibe match.
- **No collaborative signal:** There is no "other users who like X also liked Y" dimension. The system cannot discover unexpected connections.
- **Binary category matching:** Genre and mood are exact-match strings. "indie pop" never matches "pop" even though they are closely related.
- **Acoustic signal is weak:** The +0.3 / +0.5 acoustic bonus barely influences rankings compared to genre (+2.0).

## Reflection

See [model_card.md](model_card.md) for a full analysis.

Building this project made it clear how much simple weighting rules already "feel" like recommendations — even without any user history or machine learning. Choosing what to score (and how much to weight it) turned out to be the most impactful decision, more so than any implementation detail. Changing the genre weight from 2.0 to 1.0 completely rearranged the top-5 list.

The filter-bubble problem also became immediately visible: if a user's favorite genre is one of only two pop tracks in the catalog, those tracks will always dominate, no matter how much the user loves high-energy music. Real platforms solve this partly by growing their catalog and partly by injecting diversity penalties — both of which this simulation skips.
